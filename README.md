# Airbnb mocking mobile app (iOS)

This is my first project on React Nativeâ€”and my last project during the React/Node.js Bootcamp I followed at Le Reacter (https://www.lereacteur.io/).
It's a simple airbnb mocking interface that uses the schools' own airbnb-like API.
Although it's essentially a training exercice, with limited features (for instance: the user can't publish any room), I aimed to make it as smooth and user-friendly as possible.

## Modules, tools and coding strategies I tried on this project

The project was built using Expo over Yarn, and tested directly on my iPhone 15 Pro Max.
I tried as much as possible to keep files small, by factorizing components.

I put together most of what I learned about React Native so far:

- Expo Router
- Hooks:
  - useState
  - useEffect
  - useContext
  - useRef
  - useCallback
  - useFocusEffect
  - usePathname
- Axios
- AsyncStorage
- React Native Maps + Expo Location
- Expo ImagePicker

## Some features
